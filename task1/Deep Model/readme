# Deep model for 2nd Social Media Mining for Health Applications Shared Task at AMIA 2017

Implementation of CNN and attention based CNN model.
 * By default, training, deveploment and test set on ``data_sample`` directory.

## Required Packages
- Python 2.7
- numpy
- theano
- sklearn
- nltk

## Usage

Please note that this model takes as input the path of the data folder and not paths to each individual file. A data folder is expected to have the following files: `train_ids.txt`, `dev_ids.txt`, `test_ids.txt`, and `dataset.txt`. Please see the example_dataset directory for an example of the format. 

- More info about the dataset format can be found [here](https://github.com/sifei/2nd-Social-Media-Mining-for-Health-Applications-Shared-Task-at-AMIA-2017/tree/master/task1/data_sample).

- Depending on the classes in your dataset, lines 105 and 106 in `train.py` must be changes to include them.

- To designate negative classes for the purpose of computing F1, see lines 270 in `model.py`.

### Training and Evaluating

```
python train.py --datapath=example_dataset
```

```
usage: train.py [-h] [--datapath DATAPATH] [--optimizer OPTIMIZER]
                [--batch-size BATCH_SIZE] [--num-epoch NUM_EPOCH]
                [--learning-rate LEARNING_RATE]
                [--embedding-factor EMBEDDING_FACTOR] [--decay DECAY_RATE]
                [--keep-prob KEEP_PROB] [--num-cores NUM_CORES] [--seed SEED]

Train and evaluate CharLSTM on a given dataset

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --datapath DATAPATH   path to the train/dev/test dataset
  --optimizer OPTIMIZER
                        choose the optimizer: default, rmsprop, adagrad, adam.
  --batch-size BATCH_SIZE
                        number of instances in a minibatch
  --num-epoch NUM_EPOCH
                        number of passes over the training set
  --learning-rate LEARNING_RATE
                        learning rate, default depends on optimizer
  --embedding-factor EMBEDDING_FACTOR
                        learning rate multiplier for embeddings
  --decay DECAY_RATE    exponential decay for learning rate
  --keep-prob KEEP_PROB
                        dropout keep rate
  --num-cores NUM_CORES
                        seed for training
  --seed SEED           seed for training
